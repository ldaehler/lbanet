<text id="0">Good day.</text>
<text id="1">You must be Twinsen. Like you, we have rebelled against that madman FunFrock - and you saw what's left of the city. @ We don't believe that the Northern hemisphere has become uninhabitable like the propaganda says it has. There may even be some survivors living there who refused to be deported. This is why we have decided to take the road leading to the Okojo pass by force. It leads to the Northern hemisphere. Unfortunately, our leader, Colonel Kroptman, was captured during the attack. We believe that he is still being held in the small fort that guards the pass. Help us free him by raiding the fort. You will be able to get to the Northern hemisphere if you do so. Go back to the hangar, there is a commando waiting for you in the boat.</text>
<text id="2">Go give your boss FunFrock this message for me, traitor! </text>
<text id="3">Hi! If I take your flag to be representative of your intentions, I see that you too have chosen Liberty. Lieutenant Grap is down in the trench, go see him - he'll tell you where our leaders are.</text>
<text id="4">So, young quetch, you've come to help in the fight against FunFrock? As you can see, this city has suffered because of our rebellion. We are constantly bombed, which is why our leaders have set their camp in the center of the island. You can take my buggy to go see them.</text>
<text id="5">Welcome to... AAARRGHH ! @ @  ... glb </text>
<text id="6"></text>
<text id="7">Where do you want to go?</text>
<text id="8">To Citadel Island.</text>
<text id="9">To Principal Island.</text>
<text id="10">To the White Leaf Desert.</text>
<text id="11">To Proxima island.</text>
<text id="12">I'm staying here.</text>
<text id="13">Go see Grap first if you want to drive. He's a rabbibunny and he's down in the trench.</text>
<text id="14">Twinsen, you MUST SUCCEED in this mission. That fort is in a strategic position of the utmost importance. Once we've taken it, the two hemispheres can be united once again. </text>
<text id="15">We're going to help you take the fort: you will guide me, and I'll follow you with my grenades! Whatever you do, wait for me before you change zones and don't forget to neutralize the emitter. We won't talk during the combats and if I bite it, another rebel will come and take my place, he'll wait for you at the landing site.</text>
<text id="16"></text>
<text id="17">I'm looking for the plans of the Teleportation Center.</text>
<text id="18">You're now one of us, Twinsen.</text>
<text id="19">Be careful behind the wheel, this isn't a go cart!</text>
<text id="20">Calm down! Save your strength for the clones.</text>
<text id="21">Hey, you look familiar! I just came back from an infiltration mission in Proxim-City and I saw your mug on quite a few wanted posters.</text>
<text id="22">I've heard about an underground city that the clones use as a meeting place. It's in the Northern hemisphere, on Tippet island. You should check it out!</text>
<text id="23">Ask Grap. He's in the trench, he'll know where to find them.</text>
<text id="24">The end is near for FunFrock.</text>
<text id="25">You must wait for your partner when you change zones if you want to make it through this mission.</text>
<text id="26">Thank you Twinsen, we couldn't have done it without you.</text>
<text id="27">Try over at Funky-Town. You can buy anything over there!</text>
<text id="28">No more gas.</text>
<text id="29">To the Hamalayi mountains.</text>
<text id="30"></text>
<text id="31">To the rebel camp.</text>
<text id="32">To the harbour.</text>
<text id="33">I haven't seen them. @ Sorry!</text>
