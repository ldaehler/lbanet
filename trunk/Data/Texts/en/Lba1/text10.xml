<text id="0">Good day.</text>
<text id="1">Catch anything?</text>
<text id="2">I'm trying to find my bracelet...</text>
<text id="3">Hold on, I've got something!</text>
<text id="4">I know this hemisphere very well, for 10 Kashes I'll tell you what FunFrock is concocting here.</text>
<text id="5">Our leaders don't know that we come here, it's the only place where we can put these blasted helmets down. I'm here for business only: I can sell you information about anything. See you later...</text>
<text id="6">Did you know that there is a means of getting to Fortress island in my basement? I'll let you in there if you improve the quality of the show. The atmosphere is terrible nowadays, the patrons are bummed out.</text>
<text id="7">That's much better, go on it! But be careful - there are still a few giant crabs. Thanks again!</text>
<text id="8">With an atmosphere like this, I'm gonna be rich!</text>
<text id="9">Our group is sort of lacking: we don't have half the material we need, and we're eight hit songs short of an album. I'm begging you: find a guitar for me!</text>
<text id="10">I must be hallucinating, look, he found the Space Guitar!</text>
<text id="11">I think we've got a hit here, thanks pal!</text>
<text id="12"></text>
<text id="13">No more gas.</text>
<text id="14">L.B.A. @ Funky-Town sewer service </text>

<text id="17">L.B.A. @ Funky-Town sewer service @ Swindler street </text>

<text id="22">Good day. Let's see, you can talk to me and you're wearing the Medallion of Sendell: you must be the Heir! I've been waiting for you for centuries and I've got a backache so we'll go carefully. The Hamalayi mountains are too high for me but I can lead you through this entire hemisphere, except for Polar island: it is too well guarded by FunFrock. Where do you want to go?</text>
<text id="23">Where do you want to go Twinsen?</text>
<text id="24"></text>
<text id="25">I don't know where they are.</text>
<text id="26">Where do you want to go?</text>
<text id="27">To Brundle island.</text>
<text id="28">To Fortress island.</text>
<text id="29">To the Hamalayi mountains.</text>
<text id="30">I'm staying here.</text>
<text id="31">Ask one of the helmet-less groboclones, they come here to traffic and listen to music.</text>
<text id="32">I'm non-violent.</text>
<text id="33">Ha ha, I was the watchman on the construction site of the Teleportation Center. So for 50 Kashes I can tell you EXACTLY where those plans are.</text>
<text id="34">Thief, that's too expensive!</text>
<text id="35">Sold!</text>
<text id="36">You don't have enough Kashes, my poor little quetch.</text>
<text id="37">The plans for this center are in FunFrock's personal safe. In his headquarters on Principal island. But to get in you must be able to defeat the Supergros (the nurses equipped with tablet launchers!).</text>
<text id="38">Hi, nice weather huh?</text>
<text id="39">I refuse to fight when I'm not on duty.</text>
<text id="40">So, which one of FunFrock's factories do you want information about?</text>
<text id="41">I don't givre credit, come back when you're richer!</text>
<text id="42">The mutant factory.</text>
<text id="43">FunFrock cleared out the populations from this hemisphere but there are still a few people that resist like here in Funky-Town. He produces mutant insects in his factory at the foot of the Hamalayi mountains to exterminate us. The factory was supposedly sabotaged, but there are still monsters in the sewers: they were produced before the sabotage. In fact, you can jump on the giant crabs!</text>
<text id="44">The Teleportation Center.</text>
<text id="45">It is located on Brundle island, from there FunFrock's cohorts control all the planet's teleportations! The entrance is guarded but they will let you in if you act like one of them.</text>
<text id="46">The Cloning center.</text>
<text id="47">The center where all the planet's clones are produced is inside FunFrock's Fortress. It's his headquarters when he is in this hemisphere. Be careful because I heard that he is working on some VERY special clones, it's on Fortress island.</text>
<text id="48">See you later.</text>
<text id="49">That type of information is too specific, ask one of the helmet-less groboclones that are here instead.</text>
<text id="50">Your hydroglider is great! But you won't make it to Fortress island or to Polar island with it. They are isolated by the currents, no ship can find them. You need a Dino-Fly to go there.</text>
<text id="51">Ask the rabbibunny with the sunglasses, he's an informer.</text>
<text id="52">Good day</text>
<text id="53"></text>
<text id="54">I'm looking for the plans for the Teleportation Center.</text>
<text id="55">Calm down, I'll only let you in if the audience likes the group. Work it out with the guitarist!</text>
<text id="56">Ask the rabbibunny with the sunglasses who is at the entrance to Funky-Town, he's an informer.</text>
<text id="57">Those guys on stage are fabulous! @ But it's too bad that they don't play anything.</text>
<text id="58">Wow! Never heard anything like that before, they are too much!</text>
<text id="59">Be quiet, you'd do yourself a favor if you listen to that, it's fabulous!</text>
<text id="60">I don't know what it is.</text>
<text id="61">You don't have enough Kashes.</text>
<text id="62">Good day, if you like an item, move in front of it and use the ACTION command.</text>
<text id="63">Thief!</text>
<text id="64">Ouch!</text>
<text id="65">Gas for 10 voyages costs 40 Kashes.</text>
