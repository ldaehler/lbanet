<text id="0">Maritime Museum, rates: @ Children ... 3 Kashes @ Adults ... 5 Kashes. " </text>
<text id="1">Welcome to Proxim-City @ (Proxima Island). </text>
<text id="2">Guard post - open 24 hours a day. Do not disturb... </text>
<text id="3">Appropriate attire required! </text>
<text id="4">I'm looking for the plans of the Teleportation Center.</text>
<text id="5">To Principal Island.</text>
<text id="6">To Citadel Island.</text>
<text id="7">We'll see about that later.</text>
<text id="8">For 10 Kashes, where do you want to go, Twinsen ?</text>
<text id="9">Sorry, you don't have enough Kashes. I've got kids to feed you know!</text>
<text id="10">Good day, a ticket for the museum costs 5 Kashes. Would you like one?</text>
<text id="11">Yes, I'll take one.</text>
<text id="12">No, museums put me to sleep.</text>
<text id="13">Sorry, but you don't have enough Kashes.</text>
<text id="14">Rear starboard propeller of the FunFrock 2. It was lost when the ship was launched from Principal island. The boat ran out of gas three days later, and finally stopped turning around in circles. </text>
<text id="15">Captain LeBorgne's treasure. This chest contains the fruits of a lifetime of dishonesty. It was seized by the IRS, the only predator known to this terrible pirate. </text>
<text id="16">Loan shark. This species of shark belongs to the movie producer family. </text>
<text id="17">Reed Boat or Quffa. Primitive boat made from weaved reeds.</text>
<text id="18">Boarding cannon. </text>
<text id="19">Oak barrel. Barrels such as this one were used to serve up the daily rations of rum to the sailors. </text>
<text id="20">BÃ¹ian Mermaid. A fine example of the absurdity of ancient superstitions: this statue was found in the middle of a desert. </text>
<text id="21">Lifeboat. Do not pierce, burn, or bring into contact with an incandescent object. </text>
<text id="22">Life candies: would you like 10 hearts for 10 Kashes? </text>
<text id="23">Ok, I'll take them.</text>
<text id="24">No thank you.</text>
<text id="25">Not enough Kashes !</text>
<text id="26">Halt. It is forbidden to touch the exhibits.</text>
<text id="27">Sound the alarm! It's the escapee!</text>
<text id="28">Construction work. SLOW DOWN! </text>
<text id="29">I am the Eclipse Stone. The password for the Marked Stone is "BURBS". Which word will free me? </text>
<text id="30">I am the Marked Stone. The password for the Eclipse Stone is "GIZMO". Which word will free me? </text>
<text id="31">I don't know.</text>
<text id="32">BURBS </text>
<text id="33">GIZMO </text>
<text id="34">My brother was arrested and the house is under surveillance: phony red card traffic. Wait a minute, how did you get in here? And who are you?</text>
<text id="35">My name is Twinsen. I met your brother. He is in jail but is fine for the moment. He told me to mention the word "Amos" to you.</text>
<text id="36">My name is Twinsen and I am the Heir... @ voila, voila, voila.</text>
<text id="37">Ah! Ok. Then you might need this.</text>
<text id="38">I'm really happy for you, Twinsen! But my brother is being held in FunFrock's headquarters. His cell has a window that is right on the street. If you could tell me how he's doing, I will give you a red card in gratitude.</text>
<text id="39">You've just rediscovered all the objects that are in your inventory!</text>
<text id="40">L.B.A. @ Proxim-City sewer service @ Ferry Street </text>
<text id="41"></text>
<text id="42">I've been trying to sell this hair dryer ever since I was on Principal island! Come on, I know you can use one for 30 Kashes.</text>
<text id="43">You don't have enough Kashes, see you later.</text>
<text id="44">I don't have anything else to sell!</text>
<text id="45">Aah, I see that you too have come to Proxima island. You remember me, I sell hair dryers. Look, I'll sell you one for only 30 Kashes, but only because it's been a slow day.</text>
<text id="46">Don't know what you're talking about.</text>
<text id="47">I've been working on a Jet-Pack prototype for days now. It's a small reactor that harnesses onto your back and allows you to fly about. My problem is that my last test flight wreaked a bit of havoc on the garden wall. It is rather difficult to fine tune the motor's power. I need a rheostat like the one you find in a hair dryer. Do you think you can find one of those for me? </text>
<text id="48">So you found a hair dryer? Great! I'll be with you in a minute, just let me install the rheostat. </text>
<text id="49">Well it's not a Jet-Pack yet, it's still just a Proto-Pack. I would appreciate it if you could test it out to see how it works. You should be able to fly over the water if you approach it from a gently sloping beach. But don't jump! Will you test it for 10 Kashes?</text>
<text id="50">How's the Proto-Pack coming along? Keep testing, I have a bunch of calculations to finish up. And be careful when approaching water: you can only fly by coming in from a gently sloping beach.</text>
<text id="51">Our heroic clone troops are responding to the rising rebel threat with a series of bombardments. </text>
<text id="52">Skull flag. Pirate emblem belonging to the famous pirate Captain LeBorgne. " </text>
<text id="53">The museum's alarm system has been activated: we have evacuated the premises for your security. We will open up again later! </text>
<text id="54">There was a false alarm at the museum. The only way out was through the sewers, but the grate was not moved, so we're reopening the building.</text>
<text id="55">Good day.</text>
<text id="56">Sorry, but you don't have enough Kashes.</text>
<text id="57">Welcome, dear customer, and thank you for honoring my humble establishment with your presence. Move in front of the item that you desire and use the ACTION command.</text>
<text id="58">Thief! @ @ Leave my money box alone!</text>
<text id="59">You're too aggressive! Come back when you've calmed down a bit!</text>
<text id="60">Where do you want to go?</text>
<text id="61">Citadel Island.</text>
<text id="62">The White Leaf Desert.</text>
<text id="63">Rebellion Island. </text>
<text id="64">Gas for 10 voyages costs 30 Kashes.</text>
<text id="65">15 hearts of life powder will cost you 30 Kashes.</text>
<text id="66">10 flasks of magic powder will cost you 30 Kashes.</text>
<text id="67">One meca-pinguin costs 3 Kashes.</text>
<text id="68">My brother is in onse of the cells that has a window on the street, in FunFrock's headquarters. And you know, if you tell me how he is doing, I'll give you a red card.</text>
<text id="69">I'm not interested.</text>
<text id="70">I don't know where they are.</text>
<text id="71">I don't know what you're talking about.</text>
<text id="72">Don't touch the alarm button, the grobo is wiring it as we speak. And in any case, it is forbidden to touch it!</text>
<text id="73">Then go to the museum. And along those lines, don't touch the alarm button on the wall! </text>
<text id="74">Well you can believe me if you want, but the museum is well protected! I just connected this button to the alarm system: the building is evacuated as soon as it is pressed. @ Only one or two automatic guards will remain. It also sets off a series of sensors under the wooden floor that will sound the alarm as soon as they detect even the slightest weight. You would have to be able to fly to move around in there!</text>
<text id="75">I think you're going to get hit, if you keep playing with that button!</text>
<text id="76">I know that they have something about him in the museum. </text>
<text id="77">That name sounds familiar. Go visit the Maritime museum, I think that they have two objects that belonged to LeBorgne.</text>
<text id="78">Oh yes, it's great!</text>
<text id="79">What about my test flights? I'm not paying you to test your shoes!</text>
<text id="80">I've been working on a Jet-Pack prototype for days now. It's a small reactor that is harnessed on the back and allows its user to fly about. My problem is that my latest flight test wreaked havoc on my Southern wall. So I'd like to borrow the rheostat in your hair dryer to fine tune the power of the motors (from looking at your hairdo, I don't think you really need the dryer, anyway). And if that works, I will have a job offer for you.</text>
<text id="81">Well, well. It seems that you too have found an authentic secret map of Captain LeBorgne! Do me a favor would you? Give Lanktir, who lives next to the bazaar, back his coffee pot. I'm so ashamed, I should have given it back long ago.</text>
<text id="82">Go try at the museum.</text>
<text id="83">Hi!</text>
<text id="84">I'm looking for information about LeBorgne the pirate.</text>
<text id="85">No more gas.</text>
<text id="86">Ok, I will try to find one for you.</text>
<text id="87">Thanks, come back as soon as you can!</text>
<text id="88">I might have found what you where looking for...</text>
<text id="89">No no, I need a hair dryer, nothing else!</text>
<text id="90">Bye!</text>
<text id="91">I see, let's talk about something else...</text>
<text id="92">(continue)</text>
<text id="93">Yes sure!</text>
<text id="94">Thanks a lot! Here you go.</text>
<text id="95">So did you found a hair dryer?</text>
<text id="96">Do you know where I could find a hair dryer?</text>
<text id="97">I have seen a salesman wandering in town with his suitcase. You might want to go and ask him.</text>
<text id="98">Thank you, bye!</text>
<text id="99">Great! I take one!</text>
