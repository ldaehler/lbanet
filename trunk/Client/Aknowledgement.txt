Game created by Vivien Delage - aka Rincevent_123

Before starting I would like to thanks David whose perspective map viewer was of a great help in order to build my own game engine. Also thanks to alexfont and its LBAnimator that was also essential for the character animation part of my engine. The game would not have been possible without them.

Also, I would like to thanks Adeline software for creating the original LBA games. They are the reason why we are there today.

Finally, I would like to thanks the great Magicball network community for the cheer up and support.
They keep me motivated to work on the game.
