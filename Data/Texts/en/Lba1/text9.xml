<text id="0">Good day.</text>
<text id="1">You have no business here, this factory is top secret!</text>
<text id="2">Don't touch those buttons!</text>
<text id="3">Hey, you, don't touch our kitchen!</text>
<text id="4">Noble stranger, we will open the Door of the Sacred Carrot for you if you sabotage the mutant factory, from where the monsters that infest this hemisphere emerge. This door leads to the shore, and from there you can access all of this part of the planet.</text>
<text id="5">The passage that I'm opening for you leads to a port, where the old subway that crossed the Hamalayi used to leave from. </text>
<text id="6">Hey, you! Don't touch our k... oh, it's you! @ Good work, you have disabled the mutant factory! No more new monsters are being produced. By the way, what is your name, brave stranger?</text>
<text id="7">No more gas.</text>
<text id="8">Greetings! Our village is harassed by the mutants. But these monsters are not a result of the climate - they are produced in a nearby factory built by FunFrock.</text>
<text id="9">This is not really a good time! </text>
<text id="10">Thanks for your help. And, whatever you do, destroy the eggs if you are going in the factory! If you don't, new monsters will be produced and will come and attack the village.</text>
<text id="11">I don't know what that could be all about.</text>
<text id="12">Good day.</text>
<text id="13">New monsters are still coming to the village: the factory has not been completely disabled!</text>
<text id="14">And now, brave stranger Twinsen, follow me to the Door of the Sacred Carrot.</text>
<text id="15">Twinsen</text>
<text id="16">Thank you for saving this village, brave stranger Twinsen.</text>
<text id="17">I don't know what that could be all about, brave stranger Twinsen.</text>
<text id="18">It's so much calmer since you've come, do you really have to leave?</text>
<text id="19">I'd like so much to help you, Twinsen.</text>
<text id="20">Help!</text>
<text id="21">Whew, safe!</text>
<text id="22">Carrot, open up!</text>
<text id="23">I'm looking for the plans for the Teleportation Center.</text>
<text id="24">Did you know that there is a Clear Water lake very near here. It is located close to the Door of the Sacred Carrot and it has a close connection with a prophecy.</text>
<text id="25">You will have to interrogate traffickers, people that are in this hemisphere in any case. </text>
<text id="26">Where do you want to go?</text>
<text id="27">To Tippett island.</text>
<text id="28">To Fortress island.</text>
<text id="29">To Brundle island.</text>
<text id="30">I'm staying here.</text>
<text id="31">Where do you want do go, Twinsen?</text>
<text id="32">Ah, it's impossible to open without a blue card.</text>
<text id="33">To the rabbibunny village.</text>
<text id="34">To the mutant factory.</text>
<text id="35">Leave me alone! I've got work to do, and no time to play!</text>
<text id="36">Use your red card to use the skilift.</text>
<text id="37">Sorry, I don't know where they are.</text>
<text id="38">I don't know where they are.</text>
